results on the multivariate Madogram

Draft code for simulating multivariate copula.

Agenda :

Made a function to sample into a d-dimensional simplex (stochastic methods are way faster than others).
Made a method to give the value of a d-dimension Pickands.

To do :

Add derivatives of the Pickands for the symetric logistic for a given dimension

Same for asymetric but maybe in dimension 3 (the derivatives is not that regular in high dimension and might be untractable for high dimension).
